## SFTP File Transfer

In this project, I used the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) command-line tool to transfer files from my local machine to the sandbox environment. Below are the steps I followed:

### Step 1: Take Screenshots

i finished the cmd challenge and took screenshots as told

### Step 2: Establish SFTP Connection

1. Opened a terminal on my local machine.
2. I put this command sftp username@hostname (make sure to replace the username and hostname)

### Step 3: Upload Screenshots

3. Once connected, i navigated to the directory where i wanted to upload the screenshots
4. Used the "put" command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the remote server

### Step 4: Confirm Transfer

5. used ls to check 

### Step 5: Push Screenshots to GitHub

6. I went to the terminal and checked if everything is there then git add/commit/push
