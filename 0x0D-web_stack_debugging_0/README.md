# Explaining better :

The command "service apache2 start" starts the Apache HTTP Server, an open-source web server that delivers Internet content. Breaking it down:

service: Runs System V init scripts to manage system services.
apache2: The service name representing the Apache HTTP Server, often installed as 'apache2'.
start: The action to perform on the service, initiating the Apache HTTP Server to start running and serving web content.
Essentially, running this command starts the Apache HTTP Server so that it can listen for HTTP requests and respond by serving the requested web content. This is critical for setting up a web server because it ensures that the Apache software is not just installed, but is actively running and serving web content.
